				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>When I was browsing through the Generative Design examples looking for inspiration for this project, the following two examples stood out to me.</p>
				<p><a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?01_P/P_2_0_03">Example 1</a></p>
				<p><a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?01_P/P_2_2_3_01">Example 2</a></p>
				I liked these images because they immediately reminded me of the patterns in sliced agate stones, which I think are really pretty. I decided that for my project I wanted to try to use sliced agate stone as my inspiration. I then went searching for some images of agate patterns and colors, which I have included below.

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>Since one of the examples I was working from included shapes I liked, and the other included a way of arranging them that I liked, I began by trying to find a way to combine those two concepts.</p>
				<p>I decided to try modifying the example with the shape that I liked. First, I unlinked the center point of the shape from the mouse, and made it so it was centered in the middle of the page.</p>
				<p>Then, I started testing ways to make it get smaller with each addition. My first attempt was to modify the range of the amount added to the x and y calculations for the points, but that didn’t work—it just started moving the shape downward.</p>
				<p>I then tried adding a multiplier to reduce the step size with each iteration, but that didn’t work either, though it did look cool!</p>
				<p>Finally, I figured out how to do it, by checking to see which side of the center each point is on.</p>
				<p>Unfortunately, it seemed to have some trouble as points approach the x and y axis. After some modifications to a few of the variables, I finally ended up with a result I was happy with.I decided to add back in the option to click to create another shape, since I didn’t end up including the interactivity for the changing sizes. Plus, I thought it would turn out interestingly in the next step if the user can create more than one of the agate stones.</p>

				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>The shapes were looking good at this point, but they didn’t have color yet. First, I added random colors. Unfortunately, those looked more like strange candies than like agate stones. So I had to limit the color palettes.</p>
				<p>I tried a green, and then an orange-red. I liked the orange-red, but wanted to get more creative. I ended up modifying the orange-red one to feel a little more natural, and added a green and blue option. The colors are randomized per stone. It still looked a little off to me though.</p>
				<p>I removed the strokes, and I think the result looks much better. I changed the background color to black to make the colors stand out more. At this point, I’m happy with the results. I feel like the shapes do look like agate stones, and the finished results feel very different from the examples I started with.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I worked on this project by myself, so I contributed everything that is not part of the reference I used at the beginning (I left comments to indicate this in my code file.)</li>
					<li>I’m really happy with how it turned out! I know it’s not exactly groundbreaking or anything, but I don’t think art always has to be something super impressive and groundbreaking. I think the shapes and colors are pretty, and I’m really proud of how the color randomization turned out! I spent a lot of time figuring out the right values to make sure the range of colors that were generated looked good together and reasonably conveyed the concept of an agate stone.</li>
					<li>My high for the project was working on the colors. I thought that was really fun, and I’m really happy with how it turned out. My low for the project is that I kept having weird formatting issues when working on the webpage.</li>
