				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>For this project I didn’t start out with a clear idea, so I decided to look for an example I thought looked interesting and see what directions I could take it in. This was the example I decided to start from, because I thought the patterns looked pretty. I found it on the Generative Design website.</p>
				<p><a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?02_M/M_1_5_02">Example 1</a></p>
				It reminded me of water currents, but also of wood grain.

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>First, I decided to incorporate a concept I utilized in my Experiment 2, and randomize the colors. My first attempt didn’t really turn out how I’d hoped, as it applied the color to small sections of each line rather than different colors for different lines.</p>
				<p>Then, I changed how the color values were assigned so that each color would be associated with a line, rather than creating the static-like effect in the previous iteration.</p>
				<p>It was a bit hard to see the colors, so I adjusted the number and size of the strokes.</p>
				<p>I continued to experiment with some different values in the variables.</p>
				<p>I changed the color scheme to blue variants.</p>
				<p>Then I changed the opacity so everything would blur together more.</p>
				<p>That was cool, but I felt like it was a little boring. I decided to go back and try a different route. By changing the values a different way, I got it to look like fireflies. But I wasn’t super happy with that either.</p>
				<p>After spending some more time experimenting, I tried making the stroke width dynamic. That ended up looking pretty interesting. I changed the colors to white on black.</p>
				<p>The way the lines appeared gave me an interesting idea. It looked kind of like lightning. I decided in the next step, I would try to make it look more like a lightningstorm.</p>

				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>When I had finished experimenting by modifying the inspiration project and incorporating things I’d used in other projects, it was time to work on final details. I started by adding clouds.</p>
				<p>I decided to turn the clouds into sort of a frame, so I had to add them on the sides as well.</p>
				<p>Finally, I wanted to figure out how to add rain. I tried adding some lines that shift color and positioning with each loop.</p>
				<p>However, the range in positions wasn’t quite enough at this point, so I expanded the range so the rain would blend together better.</p>
				<p>That turned out much better! At this point, I was fairly happy with the results.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I worked on this project by myself, so I contributed everything that is not part of the reference I used at the beginning (I left comments to indicate this in my code file.)</li>
					<li>I think it turned out well! I learned some new concepts for this project, and I think that trying to make the project without knowing from the start what I wanted to make was interesting. That said, I think it took more effort to do it this way, and I don’t think the results were as good as last week’s project, where I decided what I wanted to make in step 1 rather than step 2. I think in future projects I will try to figure out what my goal is to create earlier in the process, because doing it the way I did this project creates extra work that doesn’t get reflected in the final result.</li>
					<li>My high for the project was the way that the clouds shifting colors turned out. I thought that looked really cool, and I was glad that it worked well the first way I tried to do it. My low for the project is that I wasn’t able to figure out how to make the rain flicker in and out without getting rid of the lightning.</li>
