				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>For this project I wanted to create something that let you create visual art by making sounds. The references I used as a base for this project were found at <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/sound-mic-threshold.html"> Example 1</a> and <a href=" http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?01_P/P_1_1_1_01.">Example 2</a> </p>
				<p>The former is an example of how to trigger an event based on the volume of the input mic, and the latter is an example of an interactive color grid that I found on the Generative Design website.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p></p>

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>First, I made it so the rectangles that were created by microphone input in the example also had colors determined by the volume of the sound. </p>
				<p>That felt too similar to the first example, so I decided to set up the grid from the second example so that the size of each square was determined by the volume.</p>
				<p>Next, I modified it so that the grid was filled in one square at a time, and the color and size were both based on the volume.</p>
				<p>I then made the grid sizes smaller, so that more sounds could be drawn at once. I started testing it by playing music next to my microphone.</p>
				<p>Then I realized that I had set up the colors incorrectly for HSB values, so I fixed that.</p>

				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>It was working how I wanted it to work, but there was an awful lot of bright green, and the super bright saturated colors weren’t really working for me. I wanted to try some ways to make that a bit more variable. First, I tried setting it up so that it would take the volume of the input twice. The first would determine the saturation, and the second would determine the color.</p>
				<p>I definitely liked that better, but I still thought it could use some improvement. I decided to try to incorporate a way to vary the image based on the time in between the sounds.</p>
				<p>I tried adjusting the brightness based on the previous volume, and the saturation by the time between sounds. I wasn’t a huge fan of how it turned out, so I decided to modify it some more.</p>
				<p>I reverted it back to the previous version, and then modified the height of the row as well as the saturations based on the volume.</p>
				<p>The overall effect was similar, but I liked the way it looked while generating. Then, I decided to switch from rectangles and circles. Figuring out how to size the circles gave me a bit of trouble. At first, I tried to do it based on the difference between the previous volume and the current volume, so that sudden sounds would look bigger.</p>
				<p>However, I felt like that gave an inaccurate sense for what the sound was like. So I decided to change it up. When the volume was getting louder, the circles would be bigger, and when the volume was getting quieter, the circles would be smaller. I thought this created a pretty effect that also helped to convey the general energy of the sounds being recorded. Ultimately, at this point I was pretty happy with what I made!</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I worked on this project by myself, so I contributed everything that is not part of the reference I used at the beginning (I left comments to indicate this in my code file.)</li>
					<li>I think it turned out well! I felt like it was a really interesting exercise to try to convert sound into visuals like this. I also felt like it touched on some concepts of data visualization, because of the way that I had to figure out how to represent different pieces of information about the sounds from the microphone. I also learned a bit about what issues can come up with audio and recording in web browsers, because there are some restrictions there that I needed to adjust for. Overall I’m really happy with how it turned out in the end!</li>
					<li>My high for the project was the way that the varying sizes of the circles turned out. It was really fun while testing to play some music where the microphone could pick it up so that I could see the way the size and color shifts matched the song, and then afterwards try to pick out which parts of the image came from which parts of the song. I thought that looked really cool, and I was glad that it worked well even though I had to try a few different methods to make it work. My low for the project is that it was really frustrating to try to get the sound recording working in the webpage, but I finally figured it out!</li>
