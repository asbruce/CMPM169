				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>When I was looking for inspiration for this project I found this example https://p5js.org/examples/3d-orbit-control.html, which gave me an idea. I wanted to create an object that the user could rotate and zoom in and out to see several layers of it. The shape of the example reminded me of an orange, so I decided to begin with that.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p></p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>To start, I wanted to establish individual segments of the orange. I started simply, by changing the shapes that were being used. </p>
				<p>Then, I changed the colors and added some lighting. After that, I added white dividers between the sections. It was starting to look like an orange! After that, I added a peel.</p>
				<p>By pressing ‘1’ and ‘2’, the user can unpeel the orange.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>For the next step I thought it might be interesting to refine the appearance of the orange. First, I started working on making the inner segments variable sizes. </p>
				<p>I wasn’t exactly satisfied with the first attempt, but I kept going. I tried adding more segments, which worked pretty well.</p>
				<p>After that I wanted to figure out the best way to have the white sections dividing the segments. My next attempt looked pretty good!</p>
				<p>At this point, I was satisfied with the interior of the orange. The outside, on the other hand, I thought needed some more work.</p>
				<p>I added textures for the orange peel and the stem. Then, I decided to test to see if zooming in through the inside of the orange gave an interesting effect like I was hoping for. Overall, I think the zoom effect actually worked surprisingly well! The geometry inside isn’t necessarily precisely accurate to the inside of an orange, but the way everything overlaps definitely evokes the same effect.</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I worked on this project by myself, so I contributed everything that is not part of the reference I used at the beginning (I left comments to indicate this in my code file.)</li>
					<li>I think it turned out well! I don’t do a lot of work in 3D so I wanted to stick with something simple. I thought this project was a great way to explore the way that different shapes fit together in a 3D space. I really like how the orange came out, I think it’s a fun little example of how to work with 3d shapes in p5.js.</li>
					<li>My high for the project was the way that the inside of the orange turned out. I was expecting to have to spend a lot more time trying to figure out the interior structure, but the overlapping ellipses actually worked out really well for the effect I was trying to create! Another would be when I realized that I could lower the detail on the structure of the orange peel in order to make the shape look a little bit rougher and help to convey the  proper texture. My low for the project is that I’m not entirely happy with how the lighting works with the interior parts of the orange. I think if I were to continue this project in the future I would see if I could figure out a way to use shaders to add more detail to the interior parts of the orange.</li>
				</ul>
			<h2>Results</h2>
