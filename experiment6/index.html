			<h1>"Drawing Drawing Drawing": Experiment 6 - Text Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>For this project I was inspired by this example: http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?01_P/P_2_3_3_01. I liked the idea of using text as a brush to paint with, and it gave me the idea to try to make the text more connected to the image being drawn.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>To start, I wanted to add the ability to select colors. I added 8 color options other than black. Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, and light gray.</p>
				<p>After experimenting with the colors, I decided to add light blue as well.</p>
				<p>Then, I set it so the text varied based on the color, so that the text would describe the colors being used.</p>
				<p>Overall, I think that turned out pretty well!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>At this point, I wanted to make my project more unique and distinct. Since it is fairly simple, I began with the font. I set it such that the font changes at the end of each word.</p>
				<p>I like how that turned out! I decided to add a way for the user to change the minimum font size.</p>
				<p>I felt that being able to change the font size would allow for the user to create more varied drawings. Overall, I’m happy with how this project turned out!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I worked on this project by myself, so I contributed everything that is not part of the reference I used at the beginning (I left comments to indicate this in my code file.)</li>
					<li>I think it turned out well! It’s on the simpler side but I think that it fits well with the theme of text art. I also enjoyed the way that the pictures you can draw with it turn out.</li>
					<li>My high for the project was the way that the changing of fonts came together. I like the effect created by the font changing with each word. My low for the project is that I felt like I did not have enough ideas on how to make it more complex. Still, I do like how it turned out!</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Results</h2>
